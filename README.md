# 🌐 World Flags Encyclopedia

## Project Description

This project is a web application developed with React that allows users to explore and discover flags of countries worldwide. The application provides a user-friendly interface to view flags, obtain detailed information about each country, and interact with various features. Additionally, it features a navigation bar allowing dynamic page navigation. The main goal of this project was to learn the basics and functionalities of React, specifically focusing on hooks such as useState and useEffect, iterative methods like .map, .slice, and .filter, and implementing routes for navigation.

## Features

- **Flag Visualization**: Displays flags of countries along with their respective information.
- **Comprehensive Country Details**: Provides detailed information about each country on hover, including their name, capital, and population.
- **Continent Filtering**: Allows users to filter countries by continent (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania).
- **Quick Navigation**: Access the "About" page and return to the homepage using the navigation bar.

## Learning Objectives 📚

- Effective use of React hooks like useState and useEffect, enabling optimal state and effects management in the application.
- Advanced manipulation of iterative methods such as .map, .slice, and .filter to dynamically organize and process data.
- Configuration and management of routes in React, facilitating smooth and structured navigation between different application pages.
